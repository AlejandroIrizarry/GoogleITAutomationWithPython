# GoogleITAutomationWithPython
Coding Exercises included on the Google IT Automation With Python Certification course from Coursera. I created these python Jyputer Notebooks and uploaded them to this repository for documentation of my work as a Computer Science student and proof of completition of the Crash Course on Python course.

Note:
  1. You can access the files locally using an IDE or Code Editor such as Visual Studio Code, which includes the Jupyter Notebook extension.
  2. Any questions, feel free to ask me at alejandroirizarry@programmer.net 
  
  Happy coding :)!
